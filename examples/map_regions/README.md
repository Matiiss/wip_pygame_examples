Here's a (hopefully not dead) link to a partial explanation of the example on discord: https://discord.com/channels/772505616680878080/1028327374011514981/1028579147045404682:

>So, I came up with an example for getting those different regions as separate objects. https://pastebin.com/TKKVd8We It uses the attached image.  Basically what it does is iterates over that image and if it encounters a non-black pixel it performs the simple filling algorithm that returns the shape that was filled as an array, that array can then be used to create a surface in the Region class from where you pretty much can do whatever with that region. It also optimizes resources by removing the found shape from the image using numpy magic. So when it's done you get a list of objects that represent each shape on that image. You could for example then save all those objects so that you don't need to iterate over the image every time you start the program, you could create a selection editing system where you can select multiple regions at once and name them some name (would help with regions that have parts that are apart from the main land or sth), then save all that data and you got yourself region selection.

Don't use anti-aliased images with this, may not work as expected or at all.
